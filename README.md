# Animal Classification Using CNN

The Animal Classification Using CNN project aims to classify animals using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It provides a simple and effective solution for detecting and categorizing animals based on input images.

## About

This project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to classify animals into predefined categories. By training on a dataset containing images of various animals, the model learns to differentiate between different species. The system is capable of accurately classifying animals, making it useful for a wide range of applications.

## Project Files

1. **Dataset**: Dataset containing images of animals used for training and validation.
2. **Animal_Classification_model.h5**: Pre-trained CNN model weights saved in HDF5 format.
3. **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
4. **Testing.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for testing the trained model.
5. **Training.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training the CNN model.

## Training

The `Training.ipynb` notebook contains the code for training the CNN model using the provided dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture definition, training process configuration, and model evaluation.

## Testing

The `Testing.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to use the trained model for animal classification. It loads the pre-trained model weights and provides a user interface for uploading images to classify. The system then predicts the animal species present in the image and displays the result.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- tkinter
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

You can install these dependencies using pip:
